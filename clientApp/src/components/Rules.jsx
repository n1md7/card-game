## Rules

At the beginning of the game, each player is dealt four cards, and four cards are placed on the table. Players take turns making moves clockwise.

A player can take cards from the table when the sum of their values is 11.

For example, if there are a 4 and a 6 on the table, a player can take them if they have a 7 (4 + 7 = 11), a 5 (6 + 5 = 11), or an Ace (4 + 6 + 1 = 11). Queens can only take Queens, and Kings can only take Kings. However, Jacks are universal cards that can take any card on the table except for Queens and Kings. If there are an even number of Queens or Kings on the table, Jacks can take them too. For example, if there are a King, a Queen, a 2, and a 4 on the table, a player can take only the 2 and the 4 with a Jack. However, if there were one more Queen on the table, the Jack could take both Queens as well. Jacks can also take other Jacks.

If the table is empty and a player places a Jack card, it must stay on the table since there are no cards to take. The same applies when there is a Queen or King on the table with an odd number - the Jack cannot take any cards, so it stays on the table. If there is no combination available to take cards, the player's card must stay on the table.

Players can make only one move at a time. In the end, there might be cards remaining on the table, which can be claimed by the player who made the last combination.
